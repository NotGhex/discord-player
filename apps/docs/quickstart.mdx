## Setup your development environment

To get started with Discord Player, you need to have a few things set up on your local machine.

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Discord Player is built on Node.js, so you need to have it installed on your machine.
-   [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm): NPM is the package manager for Node.js. You will need it to install Discord Player and its dependencies.
-   Optionally [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download): To get the best out of Discord Player, we recommend you use TypeScript, but it's not required.

### Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i discord-player @discord-player/extractor mediaplex
```

```bash yarn
yarn add discord-player @discord-player/extractor mediaplex
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add discord-player @discord-player/extractor mediaplex
```

```bash bun
bun add discord-player @discord-player/extractor mediaplex
```

</CodeGroup>

Here's what each package does:

-   `discord-player`: The core package for Discord Player.
-   `@discord-player/extractor`: A collection of audio/metadata extractors for Discord Player.
-   `mediaplex`: Efficient alternative to `@discordjs/opus` and a library that provides various media utilities.

<Note>If you are unable to install mediaplex on your system, you can install one of `@discordjs/opus`, `opusscript`, `@evan/opus` or `node-opus`.</Note>

### Creating your first bot

To create your first bot, check out the [discord.js guidebook](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html).

### Adding Discord Player to your bot

Once you have your bot set up, you can add Discord Player to your bot by following the steps below:

#### 1. Import the `discord-player` package in your bot's main file.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
import { Player } from 'discord-player';
```

```js ES Modules
import { Player } from 'discord-player';
```

```js CommonJS
const { Player } = require('discord-player');
```

</CodeGroup>

#### 2. Create a new instance of the `Player` class.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
const client = new Client({
    /* client options */
    intents: ['GuildVoiceStates' /* other intents */]
});

const player = new Player(client);
```

```js ES Modules
const client = new Client({
    /* client options */
    intents: ['GuildVoiceStates' /* other intents */]
});

const player = new Player(client);
```

```js CommonJS
const client = new Client({
    /* client options */
    intents: ['GuildVoiceStates' /* other intents */]
});

const player = new Player(client);
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>The `Client` class is provided by discord.js</Note>

<Info>**Good to know:** You don't need to add `client.player = ...`. Discord Player exposes various type-safe hooks to get around this situation.</Info>

#### 3. Register some extractors to the player.

Discord Player by default cannot play audio or pull metadata. These extractors help Discord Player to fetch audio and metadata from various sources.

<Warning>
<b>Erm! I went to discord.js server but I was told <u>"we don't support tos violations"</u>. Is Discord Player dangerous to use?</b>

First of all - No, Discord Player is not dangerous to use. The tos-violation was brought up to you because Discord Player by default loads all the extractors. Some of these extractors may violate the terms of service of the respective platforms, mainly `YouTubeExtractor`.

In the example below, we are loading all the extractors exposed by `@discord-player/extractor` except the `YouTubeExtractor`. We recommend disabling `YouTubeExtractor` for tos-compliance reasons. This also disables youtube bridge functionality on `BridgedExtractor`s such as `SpotifyExtractor` and `AppleMusicExtractor`. Discord Player will try to make the use of other extractors in this scenario.

</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
await player.extractors.loadDefault((ext) => ext !== 'YouTubeExtractor');
```

```js ES Modules
await player.extractors.loadDefault((ext) => ext !== 'YouTubeExtractor');
```

```js CommonJS
await player.extractors.loadDefault((ext) => ext !== 'YouTubeExtractor');
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>**Good to know:** Discord Player itself is not responsible for tos-violations/similar issues. The streaming behavior is entirely dependent on the extractors you load.</Info>

#### 4. Listen to the `playerStart` event

This event is emitted whenever Discord Player starts to play a track. You can use this event to notify the user when a track starts playing.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
import type { GuildQueue } from 'discord-player';
import type { TextBasedChannel } from 'discord.js';

interface Metadata {
    channel: TextBasedChannel;
}

player.events.on('playerStart', (queue: GuildQueue<Metadata>, track) => {
    queue.metadata.channel.send(`Started playing **${track.title}**!`);
});
```

```js ES Modules
player.events.on('playerStart', (queue, track) => {
    queue.metadata.channel.send(`Started playing **${track.title}**!`);
});
```

```js CommonJS
player.events.on('playerStart', (queue, track) => {
    queue.metadata.channel.send(`Started playing **${track.title}**!`);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

#### 5. Add a command to play the track.

This code shall be inside your command file. `useMainPlayer` is a hook provided by Discord Player to get the main player instance. This hook is type-safe and can be used in both TypeScript and JavaScript.

In this example, it is assumed that you have a command setup with a `query` option. Please refer to the [discord.js guidebook](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/slash-commands.html) to learn how to create commands with options.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
import { useMainPlayer } from 'discord-player';

export async function execute(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
    const player = useMainPlayer();
    // 1: Get query
    const query = interactions.options.getString('query', true);
    // 2: Get voice channel
    const voiceChannel = interaction.member.voice.channel;

    await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true });

    if (!voiceChannel) {
        return interaction.editReply('You are not connected to a voice channel!');
    }

    const queueMetadata = {
        channel: interaction.channel
    };

    try {
        // 3: Play the track
        const { track } = await player.play(voiceChannel, query, {
            nodeOptions: {
                metadata: queueMetadata
            }
        });

        return interaction.editReply(`Started playing **${track.title}** in ${voiceChannel}.`);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return interaction.editReply('Failed to play the track due to an error.');
    }
}
```

```js ES Modules
import { useMainPlayer } from 'discord-player';

export async function execute(interaction) {
    const player = useMainPlayer();
    // 1: Get query
    const query = interactions.options.getString('query', true);
    // 2: Get voice channel
    const voiceChannel = interaction.member.voice.channel;

    await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true });

    if (!voiceChannel) {
        return interaction.editReply('You are not connected to a voice channel!');
    }

    const queueMetadata = {
        channel: interaction.channel
    };

    try {
        // 3: Play the track
        const { track } = await player.play(voiceChannel, query, {
            nodeOptions: {
                metadata: queueMetadata
            }
        });

        return interaction.editReply(`Started playing **${track.title}** in ${voiceChannel}.`);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return interaction.editReply('Failed to play the track due to an error.');
    }
}
```

```js CommonJS
const { useMainPlayer } = require('discord-player');

export async function execute(interaction) {
    const player = useMainPlayer();

    // 1: Get query
    const query = interactions.options.getString('query', true);
    // 2: Get voice channel
    const voiceChannel = interaction.member.voice.channel;

    await interaction.deferReply({ ephemeral: true });

    if (!voiceChannel) {
        return interaction.editReply('You are not connected to a voice channel!');
    }

    const queueMetadata = {
        channel: interaction.channel
    };

    try {
        // 3: Play the track
        const { track } = await player.play(voiceChannel, query, {
            nodeOptions: {
                metadata: queueMetadata
            }
        });

        return interaction.editReply(`Started playing **${track.title}** in ${voiceChannel}.`);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
        return interaction.editReply('Failed to play the track due to an error.');
    }
}
```
