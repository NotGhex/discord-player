### Accessing player instance

We have seen a lot of examples where we could assign `Player` to `client.player` for easy access of the `Player` instance. But polluting client like this could be a bad idea:

```js
client.player = player;
```

This would remove intellisense as `client` does not have a property called `player`. To solve this issue, discord-player by default provides singleton constructor support. You will need to create a instance of player as shown below:

```js
const player = new Player(client);
```

The code above will not create duplicate instances of `Player`. Each time you call `Player.singleton()`, you will receive the same instance and full intellisense.

> Note: Discord Player is by default a singleton. You can bypass singleton behavior using `const player = new Player(client, { ignoreInstance: true });`


Once you initialize Player, you can access that instance of player from anywhere as shown below:

```js
const { useMainPlayer } = require('discord-player');
const player = useMainPlayer();
```
