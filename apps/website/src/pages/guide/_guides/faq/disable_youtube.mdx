# Disabling YouTube Playback

Streaming from youtube is against YouTube's terms of service. A lot of Discord Bots have been banned for streaming from YouTube. If you want to avoid getting banned, you should disable YouTube playback in your bot. Discord Player supports YouTube playback as long as you have Youtube Extractor registered. You can disable YouTube playback by not registering the Youtube Extractor.

Do not use

```js
await player.extractors.loadDefault();
```

as it loads all the extractors. Instead, filter out youtube extractor and you are done!

```js
await player.extractors.loadDefault((ext) => ext !== 'YouTubeExtractor');
```
