# Setting Bridge Source

Extractors such as `SpotifyExtractor` and `AppleMusicExtractor` cannot facilitate the audio streaming functionality. Bridging is a mechanism that allows extractors such as `AppleMusicExtractor` and `SpotifyExtractor` to provide audio stream from alternative sources. The default source for this particular case has been `YouTube` for a long time and overriding this behavior has been difficult.

The `BridgeProvider` API allows overriding default bridging mechanism and enables us to pick which source shall be used. Currently, `BridgeProvider` only supports `SoundCloud` and `YouTube` as its bridging source.

A quick example on how to set up `BridgeProvider` using `SoundCloud` as its bridge source:

### Global

```js
import { BridgeProvider, BridgeSource } from '@discord-player/extractor';

const bridgeProvider = new BridgeProvider(BridgeSource.SoundCloud);

const player = new Player(client, {
    bridgeProvider
});
```

### Individual

```js
import { BridgeProvider, BridgeSource, SpotifyExtractor } from '@discord-player/extractor';

const bridgeProvider = new BridgeProvider(BridgeSource.SoundCloud);

await player.extractors.register(SpotifyExtractor, {
    bridgeProvider
});
```
