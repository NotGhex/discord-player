# Adding events to your bot

Player state changes get emitted as events. You can attach to a particular listener to keep track of them.

List of all available events: [Link](/docs/discord-player/type/GuildQueueEvents)

The most commonly used listeners and their sample implementation are listed below:

Add these in your _index.js_ where you initialized the Discord Player instance

## General events

`queue.metadata.send()` is used here to send a message to the interaction channel.

> _NOTE : For this example to work, you will need to pass `interaction.channel` as the metadata while executing the play command. Check the example below._

<CH.Code>

```js events.js
player.events.on('playerStart', (queue, track) => {
    // Emitted when the player starts to play a song
    queue.metadata.send(`Started playing: **${track.title}**`);
});

player.events.on('audioTrackAdd', (queue, track) => {
    // Emitted when the player adds a single song to its queue
    queue.metadata.send(`Track **${track.title}** queued`);
});

player.events.on('audioTracksAdd', (queue, track) => {
    // Emitted when the player adds multiple songs to its queue
    queue.metadata.send(`Multiple Track's queued`);
});

player.events.on('playerSkip', (queue, track) => {
    // Emitted when the audio player fails to load the stream for a song
    queue.metadata.send(`Skipping **${track.title}** due to an issue!`);
});

player.events.on('disconnect', (queue) => {
    // Emitted when the bot leaves the voice channel
    queue.metadata.send('Looks like my job here is done, leaving now!');
});
player.events.on('emptyChannel', (queue) => {
    // Emitted when the voice channel has been empty for the set threshold
    // Bot will automatically leave the voice channel with this event
    queue.metadata.send(`Leaving because no vc activity for the past 5 minutes`);
});
player.events.on('emptyQueue', (queue) => {
    // Emitted when the player queue has finished
    queue.metadata.send('Queue finished!');
});
```

```js play.js
await player.play(channel, query, {
    nodeOptions: {
        metadata: interaction.channel
    }
});
```

</CH.Code>

## Debug events

<CH.Code>

```js events.js
player.on('debug', async (message) => {
    // Emitted when the player sends debug info
    // Useful for seeing what dependencies, extractors, etc are loaded
    console.log(`General player debug event: ${message}`);
});

player.events.on('debug', async (queue, message) => {
    // Emitted when the player queue sends debug info
    // Useful for seeing what state the current queue is at
    console.log(`Player debug event: ${message}`);
});
```

</CH.Code>

## Error events

<CH.Code>

```js events.js
player.events.on('error', (queue, error) => {
    // Emitted when the player queue encounters error
    console.log(`General player error event: ${error.message}`);
    console.log(error);
});

player.events.on('playerError', (queue, error) => {
    // Emitted when the audio player errors while streaming audio track
    console.log(`Player error event: ${error.message}`);
    console.log(error);
});
```

</CH.Code>
