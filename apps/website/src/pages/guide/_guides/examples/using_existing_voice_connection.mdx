# Using Existing Voice Connection

If you are manually handling voice connections, you may want to use it instead of creating another one again. In order to use your own connection, follow these steps:

> This feature is not supported with `player.play()`. If you depend upon `player.play()` for queue creation, you need to manually create the queue. You can then use `queue.play()` instead to achieve `player.play()` functionality.

### joinVoiceChannel example

```js
import { joinVoiceChannel } from 'discord-voip'

const connection = joinVoiceChannel(...);

const queue = await player.nodes.create(guild, {...});

queue.createDispatcher(connection);

// now use the queue
const { track } = await queue.play(query, { options });
```

### getVoiceConnection example

```js
import { getVoiceConnection } from 'discord-voip'

const connection = getVoiceConnection(guildId);
const queue = await player.nodes.create(guild, {...});

queue.createDispatcher(connection);

// now use the queue
const { track } = await queue.play(query, { options });
```
