# IP Rotation

Discord Player supports IP rotation which can be used to avoid getting `429` error. In order to enable IP rotation, you need to adjust your `Player` constructor.

```js
const player = new Player(client, {
    ipconfig: {
        blocks: ['fa25::/48', '2001:2::/48'] // example ip blocks
    }
    // other options as usual
});
```

In case of youtube libraries, ip rotation currently only works with the following packages:

-   [x] [youtube-ext](https://www.npmjs.com/package/youtube-ext)
-   [x] [ytdl-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ytdl-core)
-   [x] [@distube/ytdl-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@distube/ytdl-core)
-   [ ] [play-dl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/play-dl)
-   [ ] [yt-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yt-stream)
